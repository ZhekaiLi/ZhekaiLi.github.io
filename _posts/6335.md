## Types of warehouse
**Retail**
- Walmart, Target...
- Huge flow of products inbound and outbound
- Able to batch processes

**Service Parts**
- Spare parts for machinery and capital equipment
- Demand highly unpredictable $\implies$ high levels of safety stock
- Able to batch processes
- Need for predictive analytics

**E-commerce**
- very small orders
- high service level expectations
- demand can be spiky but shapable
- smart execution algorithms and optimization help

**3PL** (third party logistics)
- Multiple customers
- Economies of scale
- Subject to contractual constraints

**Humanitarian**
- Supplies are unpredictable
- Demand can also be unpredictable
- Budget constraints

**Perishables**
- Different temp
- Exip IFFO



DCs (distribution center)

## What is the Warehouse Objectve?
- What purpose does the warehouse serve?
- What market/areas does it serve?
- Is it part of a bigger network?
- What types of items will be stored?
- What is the aticipated life of ...


Inventory characteristics
- Number of products, size, turn rates
- Footprint of builidng...

Warehouse Objective
- The goal is to move items fast and on the cheap
- Operational obstacles: labor availability, variability, and low visibility
- Accuracy and Qaulity
- Ergonomics
- Flexibility
- Safety

## Picking terms and considerations
Order vs. Line vs. Unit (订单, 生产线, 产品)
- Line: unique stock keeping unit
- What we care: $Avg($line/order, units/line, units/order$)$

|Term|Definition|
|-|-
|Pick list| a document sent to your warehouse pickers to fulfill a customer order
|Pick face|  Think of it as the front (face) of your storage. If you were to measure a pick face, your measurement would contain width and height, but not depth.
|SKU density| SKU is the acronym for Stock Keeping Unit. It’s a unique identifier used by businesses to keep track of inventory and sales.  The definition of SKU varies depending on the context in which it is used. For example, if you are working with Amazon, and Amazon Product ID (or ASIN) would be your SKU. 商品种类的存放密度
|Pick density| depends on how I sort the picks. 订单的实现密度，例如如果很多订单都能从一个区域pick，那么那里的density就很高
|Single-line orders| number of orders form single line (one SKU)
|Multi-line orders| more complicate than slo. Consolidation cost: lines could be sparse $\implies$ more tiem, more labor. Also needs trade-off
|Batch picking| Batch picking, also called batching or multi-order picking, is an order picking method in which pickers simultaneously collect items for multiple orders. Batch picking is generally faster because it reduces warehouse travel time. (pick multiple orders a time) pick similar SKUs into the same container then sort them into individual orders later (Serial Process) multiple orders but similar SKU in a toe, 因此还需要 sort
|Cluster picking| For example, consider a picker with a cart that has room for nine orders, represented by carts or totes. (pick multiple orders a time in same cart, diff container without mixing) (**Parallel Process**: pick multiple orders individuallly but in parallel)
|Discrete picking| pick one order a time (pick seperately)
|Zone picking| assign loc to workers, then consolidate together
|Picking productivity| efficiency (lines/hr, SKU/hr, Orders/hr lph uph oph)
|Restock or replenish| 
|Order flow time| 
|Order integrity| 例如 cluster 和 decrete maintain integrity
|Tote| (手提袋) we care the size of tote
|Pick Wave| release to be picked in wave (set of order release together)



## Two Primary Types of Zone Picking
<img src="/images/2022-08/Snipaste_2022-08-29_10-11-14.png" width="100%">

Serial Zone
- Pro: accuracy, integrity
- need more time, low efficiency

Parallel Zone Picking:
- Pro:
- Con

## How to estimate product velocity

$$L=\lambda W$$

W: wating time (processing time)
L: storage of warehouse
$\lambda$: rate of arraival
例如货物到达的频率是 50pallets/wk, 仓库容量为 5pallets, then W = 0.1wk



## Dedicated vs. Shared Story

dedicated: slot only for on SKU
shared: if any free space, then share diff SKU
