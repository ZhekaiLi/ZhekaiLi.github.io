# 1. Descriptor for Joint Case

**Expectation (mean)**: $E[XY]=\begin{cases}\sum_x\sum_yxyp(x,y) \\ \int\int xyf(x,y)dxdy\end{cases}$

**Covariance:** $Cov[X,Y]=\begin{cases}\sum_x\sum_y(x-\mu_X)(y-\mu_Y)p(x,y) \\ \int\int(x-\mu_X)(y-\mu_Y)f(x,y)dxdy\end{cases}$

> **Relations**
$Cov[X,Y]=E[XY]-E[X]E[Y]$

**Correlation Coefficient:** 
$$\rho=\frac{Cov[X,Y]}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}$$

(1) $-1\leq\rho\leq 1$
(2) $\rho=0$ uncorrelated
(3) $\rho=-1,1$ perfect neg/pos correlated

> **S.I. vs Uncorrelated**
(1) S.I. must means uncorrelated. Since for S.I., $E[XY]=E[X]E[Y]$, then $Cov[X,Y]=0$ and $\rho=0$
(2) Uncorrelated may not means S.I.


# 2. Model Evaluation
**R-squared** (R squared)
$$R^2=1-\frac{\sum(\hat{y}_i-y_i)^2}{\sum(y_i-\bar{y})^2}$$

$R^2=1$ 最佳预测，所有的预测值等于真值
$R^2\leq0$ 无效预测，预测表现逊于全部取平均值，说明模型很可能有误

# 3. Core to Solve Problem
The key thing to calculate event probability is understanding the question and given conditions, and converting them into math(probability) equations

## 3.1 Ex1
> **Given**: Alice has 3 kids and we know one of them is a girl
> **Ask**: What is the probability that all children are girls?
1. Convert question into equation: denote $n=$ number of girls
$$P(n=3\vert\text{one is girl})=\text{?}=\frac{P(\text{one is girl}\vert n=3)}{P(\text{one is girl})}P(n=3)$$
2. Calculate each components
$P(n=3)=1/8$
$P(\text{one is girl})=1/2$
$P(\text{one is girl}\vert n=3)=1$
3. Therefore, answer is 
$$P(n=3\vert\text{one is girl})=1/4$$

The possible obstacle here is we might don't know $P(\text{one is girl})=1/2$, so just think is easy because the probability for a kid to be boy and girl are equal
