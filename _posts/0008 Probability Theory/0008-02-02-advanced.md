# 2. Model Evaluation
**R-squared** (R squared)
$$R^2=1-\frac{\sum(\hat{y}_i-y_i)^2}{\sum(y_i-\bar{y})^2}$$

$R^2=1$ 最佳预测，所有的预测值等于真值
$R^2\leq0$ 无效预测，预测表现逊于全部取平均值，说明模型很可能有误

# 3. Core to Solve Problem
The key thing to calculate event probability is understanding the question and given conditions, and converting them into math(probability) equations

## 3.1 Ex1
> **Given**: Alice has 3 kids and we know one of them is a girl
> **Ask**: What is the probability that all children are girls?
1. Convert question into equation: denote $n=$ number of girls
$$P(n=3\vert\text{one is girl})=\text{?}=\frac{P(\text{one is girl}\vert n=3)}{P(\text{one is girl})}P(n=3)$$
2. Calculate each components
$P(n=3)=1/8$
$P(\text{one is girl})=1/2$
$P(\text{one is girl}\vert n=3)=1$
3. Therefore, answer is 
$$P(n=3\vert\text{one is girl})=1/4$$

The possible obstacle here is we might don't know $P(\text{one is girl})=1/2$, so just think it easy because the probability for a kid to be boy and girl are equal



# 4. Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

For $X_i,i=1,2,...,n$ are **<font color=blue>iid</font>** (independent and identically distributed) with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ (regardless of the distribution). CLT implies that for large $n$(>30)

$$\begin{cases}
\bar X=\frac{1}{n}\sum X_i\sim N(\mu,\frac{\sigma^2}{n})
1\\
\sum X_i\sim N(n\mu,n\sigma^2)
\end{cases}$$
