# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Overview
> **Six Sigma**
- a quality management philosophy and a methodology that focuses on reducing variation, measure defects, and improving the quality of products, processes and services
- in summary, **it's a project methodology for improvement**

> **Lean**
- to maximize customer value while minimizing waste

## 1.2 Purpose of Six Sigma $6\sigma$
Six Sigma represents a stretch goal of six std from the process mean to the specification limits when the process is centered, but also allowing for a $1.5\sigma$ shift toward either specification limit. This represents a quality level of 3.4 defects per million

## 1.3 DMAIC: A Six Sigma Methodology
**DMAIC**: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control

**(1) Define**:
- Project defined
- Team selected
- Project launched (set projects goals, establish boundaries)

**(2) Measure**:
- Understand size and scope
- Measure performance on $Y=f(X)$, which is aimed to be improved


**(3) Analyze**: 
- Study data
- Define factors impacting performance
- Diagnose which $X$ factors impact $Y$

**(4) Improve**: 
Develop, implement and evaluate solutions targeted at your verified cause

**(5) Control**: 
the solution was piloted and plans made for full scale implementation. The control phase conecntrates on insuring the problem stays fixed. And the new methods can be further improved over time
