# 2. Planning & Procurement
## 2.3 Demand Forecasting
- **Qualitative Methods**: when little historical data to rely on, intuition or expert judgement is required
- **Quantitative Methods**: when historical data exists and is helpful in calculating future demand

### 2.3.1 Quantitative Forecasting Methods
- **Time Series**: models that predict future demand based on past history
- **Causal Relationships**: models that use statistical techniques to establish relationships between demand various outside factors
- **Simulation**: models that can incorporate some randomness and non-linear effects

### 2.3.2 Type of Demand Patterns

### 2.3.3 Time Series: Moving Average
$$F_{t+1}=\frac{A_t+A_{t-1}+...+A_{t-n}}{n}$$

where,
$F_{t+1}$ is the forecast for next period
$A$ is the actual sales figure from each period




## 2.4 Replenishment Planning
### 2.4.1 Independent and Dependent Demand
- **Independent Demand**: Customer demand for a finished product
- **Dependent Demand**: The demand for required component parts or subassemblies

### 2.4.2 Reorder Points
**Fixed Order Quantity**:
- Same amount of prodcut is ordered
- Order placement time varies
- When on hand inventory reaches pre-determined reorder point (**ROP**), the standard quantity is ordered
- ROP quantity is the amount of inventory needed to cover demand over then replenishment lead time

**Fixed Order Interval**:
- Product order amount varies
- Order time interval remains constant
- The inventory level is observed when the reorder time comes. Replenish order is placed to allow to inventory reach the desired level

### 2.4.3 Economic Order Quantities
Assumptions:
- Constant annual demand $D$
- Replenishment lots are always received in full requested quantities

Notations:
- $Q$: order quantity
- $C$: cost per unit
- $h$: holding cost
- $S$: cost per order

<img src="/images/2022-09/Snipaste_2022-09-29_21-22-34.png" width="100%">

$$C_T = CD + (\frac{Q}{2})(hC) + (\frac{D}{Q})S$$

take $dC_T/dQ=0$, we have **Optimal Order Quantity**
$$Q^*=\sqrt{\frac{2DS}{hC}}$$


# Others
**Stock Coverage (Inventory Coverage)**:
$$\text{Stock Coverage (days)}=\text{Net Stock/ Avg. daily unit sales}$$

**Capacity**: 
Capacity is always m / processing time with m being the number of resources (e.g. workers) being devoted to the station. If, for example, one worker needs 40 seconds to put together a sandwich, the capacity of this station is 1.5 sandwiches per minute. If there are two workers on the same station, the capacity increases to 3 sandwiches per minute.

**Bottleneck**: 
The bottleneck is defined as the process step (station) in the flow diagram with the <u>lowest capacity</u> (the “weakest link”). (although the bottleneck is often the process step with the longest processing time)

**Process Capacity**: 
The process capacity is always <u>equivalent</u> to the capacity of the bottleneck.

**Flow rate**: 
$$\text{Flow Rate}=\min\{\text{Demand, Process Capacity}\}$$



**Utilization**: 
The utilization tells us, how well a resource is being used. It is calculated as flow rate divided by capacity (e.g. 1/25). The utilization always lies between 0% and 100%.
