## Glossary for international freight
- **TEU**: Twenty-foot equivalent unit, a standard measure for ISO ocean intermodal containers
  - Standard containers: 40', 45'(2 TEUs), and 20' (1 TEU)
- **DWT**: Dead-weight metric tons
  - Maximum weight capacity (cargo, fuel, supplies, crew), or
  - Maximum loaded ship weight
- **Metric ton**: 1000 kg (~2200 lbs)


## Containers
- **(1) "Dry" Container**

- **(2) Refrigerated Container (Reefer)**: 
  need to be connected with electricity system
- **(3) Tank Container**

### Repositioning Empty Containers
- In a perfect world, every container shipment would be matched with a loaded backhaul
- About 21% of all container movements by ship are empty
- Repositioning costs add US\$3.5 billiona year to ocean carrier expenses (US\$1.5 billion intra-regional repositioning by road or rail)

## Container terminal quayside scheduling problems

### Berth scheduling problems
- A **berth** or berthing areain a seaport is where ships are moored for unloading and loading operations
- **Vessels** arrive over time to the port and need to be **served**
- Where should vessels be berthed, and in what order should they be served?
  - Planning problems when conducted with vessel scheduling
  - Operations problems (dynamic) for re-scheduling

### Berth Allocation Problem (BAP)
- Given:
  - berth layout of a container terminal
  - set of vessels to be served within a planning horizon
  - Vessel size including length, clearance, its draft;  planned time of arrival; projected handling time 
- Decide:
  - a berthing position for each vessel
  - a berthing time for each vessel
- Such that a given objective function is optimized.
