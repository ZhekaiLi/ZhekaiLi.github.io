# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Overview
> **Six Sigma**
- a quality management philosophy and a methodology that focuses on reducing variation, measure defects, and improving the quality of products, processes and services
- in summary, **it's a project methodology for improvement**

> **Lean**
- to maximize customer value while minimizing waste

## 1.2 Purpose of Six Sigma $6\sigma$
Six Sigma represents a stretch goal of six std from the process mean to the specification limits when the process is centered, but also allowing for a $1.5\sigma$ shift toward either specification limit. This represents a quality level of 3.4 defects per million

## 1.3 DMAIC: A Six Sigma Methodology
**DMAIC**: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control

### (1) Define phase:

> **(1) Develop problem and goal statements**

**Problem Statement**
- Requirements: <u>Reccuring, Specific, and Measurable</u>
- Example: the problem stated below is a chronic, reccuring problem, stated in specific and measurable terms
  <img src="/images/2022-12/Snipaste_2023-01-21_15-49-25.png" width="60%">

**Goal Statement**
- Ask ourselves: What measurable perforance outcome must the project accomplish? By when?
- Be SMART:

- Example:
  <img src="/images/2022-12/Snipaste_2023-01-21_15-54-12.png" width="60%">

We need to define what is the $Y$, the performance measure to improve, in the equation of $Y=f(x)$

> **(2) Develop project charter**

A document providing direction and focus to the team:
- Project name
- Problem and goal statements (based on step one above)
- Key Metric $Y=f(x)$
- Expected benefits (operational and finantial)
- Project scope (project boundary)
- Milestones (check point datas)
- Signatures
  - Project leader: agrees to take on project
  - Finance: validates expected financial benefits
  - Champion: approves launch of the project

> **(3) Develop a SIPOC diagram**

Purpose is to document and communicate overall scope of processes related to the project on one page

**(2) Measure**:
- Understand size and scope
- Measure performance on $Y=f(X)$, which is aimed to be improved


**(3) Analyze**: 
- Study data
- Define factors impacting performance
- Diagnose which $X$ factors impact $Y$

**(4) Improve**: 
Develop, implement and evaluate solutions targeted at your verified cause

**(5) Control**: 
the solution was piloted and plans made for full scale implementation. The control phase conecntrates on insuring the problem stays fixed. And the new methods can be further improved over time

# 2. Key Concepts in Six Sigma
## 2.1 Critical to Quality Metrics
**(1) VOC (Voice of the Customer)**: needs and expectations expressed in the customer's language

**(2) CTQs (Critial-to-Quality Requirements)**: the performance characteristics of a process, product, or service critically important to customers

<span style="background-color: yellow; color: black;">It's important to translate VOC to CTQs</span>

For example, for a pizza store:
|VOC|CTQs|Metrics|CTQs Target|
|-|-|-|-|
|"Don't want to wait too long"|On-time delivery|Order to delivery (mins)|<= 30 mins|
|"Don't want cold pizza"|Hot pizza when delivered|Pizza temperature (degrees)|>= 32 degrees|

**Six Sigma Basic Premise**:
$$Y=f(X)$$

- $Y_1=$ delivery time
- $Y_2=$ pizza temperature
- $X=$ factors affecting $Y_1,Y_2$

## 2.2 Defect Opportunities
(1) For a **marker**, there might be **5** defect opportunities such as leak, ink color, cap...

(2) For a **PC**, there might be **1000** defect opportunies

Let's assume either marker or PC have 2 defects per unit, then

> **DPO (defects per opportunity)**
- Marker: 2/5 = 0.4 DPO
- PC: 2/1000 = 0.002 DPO

> **DPMO (defects per million opportunities)**
- Marker: 0.4 DPO * 1,000,000 = 400,000 DPMO
- PC: 0.002 DPO * 1,000,000 = 2,00 DPMO

## 2.3 Sigma Level
A performance metric used to indicate the quality level of a product, process, or service
