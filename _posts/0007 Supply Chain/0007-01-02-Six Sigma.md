# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Overview
**Six Sigma**
- a quality management philosophy and a methodology that focuses on reducing variation, measure defects, and improving the quality of products, processes and services

**Lean**
- to maximize customer value while minimizing waste

## 1.2 Purpose of Six Sigma $6\sigma$
Six Sigma represents a stretch goal of six std from the process mean to the specification limits when the process is centered, but also allowing for a $1.5\sigma$ shift toward either specification limit. This represents a quality level of 3.4 defects per million

## 1.3 DMAIC: A Six Sigma Methodology
**DMAIC**: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control
- Define Phase: set projects goals, establish boundaries
- Measure Phase: pinpoint the location or source of problems by building a factual understanding of existing process condictions, establish a baseline capability level
- Analyze Phase: develop theories of root causes, confirm theoreis with data, and identify the root causes of the porblem
- Improve Phase: develop, implement and evaluate solutions targeted at your verified cause
- Control Phase: the solution was piloted and plans made for full scale implementation. The control phase conecntrates on insuring the problem stays fixed. And the new methods can be further improved over time
