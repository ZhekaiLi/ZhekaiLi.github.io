# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Overview
> **Six Sigma**
- a quality management philosophy and a methodology that focuses on reducing variation, measure defects, and improving the quality of products, processes and services
- in summary, **it's a project methodology for improvement**

> **Lean**
- to maximize customer value while minimizing waste

## 1.2 Purpose of Six Sigma $6\sigma$
Six Sigma represents a stretch goal of six std from the process mean to the specification limits when the process is centered, but also allowing for a $1.5\sigma$ shift toward either specification limit. This represents a quality level of 3.4 defects per million

## 1.3 DMAIC: A Six Sigma Methodology
**DMAIC**: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control

### (1) Define phase:

> **(1) Develop problem and goal statements**

**Problem Statement**
- Requirements: <u>Reccuring, Specific, and Measurable</u>
- Example: the problem stated below is a chronic, reccuring problem, stated in specific and measurable terms
  <img src="/images/2022-12/Snipaste_2023-01-21_15-49-25.png" width="60%">

**Goal Statement**
- Ask ourselves: What measurable perforance outcome must the project accomplish? By when?
- Be SMART:
  <img src="/images/2022-12/Snipaste_2023-01-21_15-52-42.png" width="60%">
- Example:
  <img src="/images/2022-12/Snipaste_2023-01-21_15-54-12.png" width="60%">

We need to define what is the $Y$, the performance measure to improve, in the equation of $Y=f(x)$

> **(2) Develop project charter**

A document providing direction and focus to the team:
- Project name
- Problem and goal statements (based on step one above)
- Key Metric $Y=f(x)$
- Expected benefits (operational and finantial)
- Project scope (project boundary)
- Milestones (check point datas)
- Signatures
  - Project leader: agrees to take on project
  - Finance: validates expected financial benefits
  - Champion: approves launch of the project

> **(3) Develop a SIPOC diagram**

Purpose is to document and communicate overall scope of processes related to the project on one page

<img src="/images/2022-12/Snipaste_2023-01-21_15-43-14.png" width="60%">


### (2) Measure phase
**Steps**:
1. Develop data collection plan
2. Map relevant processes
3. Validate measurement system
4. Measure the $Y$ in $Y=f(X)$

> **(1) Data collection plan**:

1. List specific questions regarding $Y$
2. Tools needed
3. Sources of data
4. Type (continuous/discrete) and quantity of data required

**Continuous** data graphs:
<img src="/images/2022-12/Snipaste_2023-01-27_23-26-31.png" width="60%">

**Discrete** data graphs:
<img src="/images/2022-12/Snipaste_2023-01-27_23-27-40.png" width="40%">


> **(2) Process Map**: 

A visual representation of the steps that take place in a process, from start to finish. Ex: <u>Wake-up-and-get-to-work Process</u>
<img src="/images/2022-12/Snipaste_2023-01-27_23-16-44.png" width="90%">

> **(3) Validate Data: use Measurement system analysis (MSA)**

Requirements of a valid measurement: (using an example of weight scale 体重秤)
- <u>Accurate with no bias</u>: the scale should be calibrated
- <u>Repeatable</u>: if I weigh myself twice in a short time, the results should be same
- <u>Reproducible</u>: my weight in my home should be the same as my weight in my doctor's office

### (3) Analyze phase:
**Purpose**: Determine which $X$(s) impact $Y$ in $Y=f(X)$

**Steps**:
1. List potential $X$(s) that impact $Y$
2. Organize potential $X$(s)
3. Shortlist and select key $X$(s)
4. Develop data collection plan for the analysis
5. Prove the key $X$(s) in $Y=f(X)$

> **(1) List potential $X$(s) that impact $Y$**: brainstorm

> **(2) Organize potential $X$(s)**: use <u>Cause-effect diagram (fishbone)</u>

**Ex: CE Diagram for Pizza Crust Problem (饼皮太硬)**
- Fishbone:
<img src="/images/2022-12/Snipaste_2023-01-28_09-07-48.png" width="70%">
- Treemap (use Excel):
<img src="/images/2022-12/Snipaste_2023-01-28_09-10-19.png" width="75%">

> **(3) Shortlist and select key $X$(s)**: based on the upper diagram

> **(4) Develop data collection plan for the analysis**

- Which hypotheses to test
- What data to collect
- How much data we need
- Collect from whom, when, where

> **(5) Prove the key $X$(s) in $Y=f(X)$**: Validation Process

- Inferential statistics
- Hypothesis test

**Ex: Analyze and validate throught graphs and charts**, using Pizza Crust Problem (饼皮太硬问题). To validate two potential $X$
- $X_1$: one or two resteraunt at fault
- $X_2$: Variation in oven temperatures

$X_1$ is proved using <u>Pareto Chart for Crust Complaints by Store Location</u>

<img src="/images/2022-12/Snipaste_2023-01-28_09-29-34.png" width="50%">

$X_2$ is proved using <u>Dotplot and Boxplot for Temp Variation by Chef</u>

<img src="/images/2022-12/Snipaste_2023-01-28_09-37-39.png" width="80%">

### (4) Improve phase:
**Purpose**: Address proven key $X$(s) and find solutions (best combination of key $X$(s)) to improve $Y$

**Steps**:
1. Potential solutions for proven key $X$(s)
2. Solution alternatives
3. Right set of solutions to implement

> **Generate, evaluate, and select solutions**

Evaluate solutions:

<img src="/images/2022-12/Snipaste_2023-01-28_10-33-55.png" width="70%">

Select solutions: Pugh Matrix (Criteria selection matrix)

<img src="/images/2022-12/Snipaste_2023-01-28_10-34-50.png" width="55%">

> **Reduce the risk of failure through FMEA**

**FMEA** (Failure Modes and Effect Analysis) is a tool to help anticipate and mitigate risk of failure.

Order failure modes by <u>Risk Priority Number (RPN)</u>:

$$RPN=\text{Severity}\times\text{Occurrence}\times\text{Detection}$$

- $\text{Severity}$: What's the effect? How severe is it (1-10)?
- $\text{Occurrence}$: What are potential causes? How likely is the occurrence of potential causes (1-10)?
- $\text{Detection}$: What process controls are in place to detect cause or failure mode? What's the likelihood of detection (1-10)?

> **Mistake proofing (防范错误)**

Adding mistake proofing to projects will be helpful. Three levels of mistake proofing:
1. **Prevention**
   - Ex: Change the <u>operation sequence of ATM to prevent forgeting to remove card after taking cash</u>
   - Swap steps 4 and 6, that is, can only take cash after removing card
  <img src="/images/2022-12/Snipaste_2023-01-28_10-58-24.png" width="30%">
2. **Facilitation**: if prevention is not applicable
   - Ex: To avoid the cashier typing an inccorect price, try to scan Bar Code instead
3. **Detection**:
   - Ex: Spelling error detection in Word

### (5) Control phase:
**Purpose**: Control of key $X$ factors to ensure improved $Y$ is <u>sustainable</u>

**Steps**:
1. Develop plan (Monitor, control, regulate performance)
2. Work with owners to update procedures
3. Implement and monitor performance
4. Validate financial impact
5. Secure project completion sign-off

> **Control Plan**

Control plan is the blueprint to ensure the right controls are implemented to achieve sustainable targets:
1. Control subject: what needs to be controlled
   - Ex: oven temperature
2. Specification, target, or desired range
   - Ex: target 22C, hot more than 24C, cold less than 19C
3. How feedback is provided
4. When and what action to take
   - Ex: when temp above 25, turn off AC; when below 15, turn off AC, or turn on heat if needed
5. Who is authorized to monitor and take action?

the solution was piloted and plans made for full scale implementation. The control phase conecntrates on insuring the problem stays fixed. And the new methods can be further improved over time

# 2. Key Concepts in Six Sigma
## 2.1 Critical to Quality Metrics
**(1) VOC (Voice of the Customer)**: needs and expectations expressed in the customer's language

**(2) CTQs (Critial-to-Quality Requirements)**: the performance characteristics of a process, product, or service critically important to customers

<span style="background-color: yellow; color: black;">It's important to translate VOC to CTQs</span>

For example, for a pizza store:
|VOC|CTQs|Metrics|CTQs Target|
|-|-|-|-|
|"Don't want to wait too long"|On-time delivery|Order to delivery (mins)|<= 30 mins|
|"Don't want cold pizza"|Hot pizza when delivered|Pizza temperature (degrees)|>= 32 degrees|

**Six Sigma Basic Premise**:
$$Y=f(X)$$

- $Y_1=$ delivery time
- $Y_2=$ pizza temperature
- $X=$ factors affecting $Y_1,Y_2$

## 2.2 Defect Opportunities
(1) For a **marker**, there might be **5** defect opportunities such as leak, ink color, cap...

(2) For a **PC**, there might be **1000** defect opportunies

Let's assume either marker or PC have 2 defects per unit, then

> **DPO (defects per opportunity)**
- Marker: 2/5 = 0.4 DPO
- PC: 2/1000 = 0.002 DPO

> **DPMO (defects per million opportunities)**
- Marker: 0.4 DPO * 1,000,000 = 400,000 DPMO
- PC: 0.002 DPO * 1,000,000 = 2,00 DPMO

## 2.3 Sigma Level
A performance metric used to indicate the quality level of a product, process, or service
