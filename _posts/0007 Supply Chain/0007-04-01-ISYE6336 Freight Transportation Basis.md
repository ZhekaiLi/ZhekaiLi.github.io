Carriers

Public vs. private carriers
- *Public carrier*: offers service for sale to other companies
  - Spot market (eg. United Airlines, FedEx)
  - Contract
- *Private carrier*: provides internal service to a shipper
  - Walmart, Publix, Exxon-mobil have significant private carrier operations 

## 3. Modes
> **Mode**
> An imprecise concept that refers roughly to the type of transportation service. Distinguished by some of the following:
> - Equipment type (eg. 固体液体容器不同)
> - Commodity capabilities 
> - Cost
> - Transit time
> - Transit time reliability

Historical modes: Air freight, Trucking or motor freight, Railroad, Water freight, Pipeline

> **Intermodal**
> Intermodal transportation often refers to containerized transportation operated with multiple modes, including:
> 1. International ocean container intermodal (ocean plus railroad and/or truck)
> 2. Domestic container intermodal (railroad plus truck)
> 3. Air freight intermodal (air plus truck)

**Shipment size**: weight and volume(cube)

volume capacity of a train car could be 3 time of a single car. Also, a train only needs 2 operators, much less than 300 drivers

## 4. Freight Resources
Problems in freight transportation system design, planning, and control center on decisions about how to use resources to accomplish objectives
1. **Mobile resources**
   - Distinguishing feature of transport systems
   - Especially challenging to manage
   - Sometimes owned, operated, maintained by others
2. **Fixed resources** (physical infrastructure)
   - Often owned, operated, maintained by others

### 4.1 Mobile Resources
> **(1) Containers**
> Vessels into which freight is packed for movement
> - Sometimes nested (smaller into larger) (套娃)
> - Sometimes integrated with vehicles, sometimes separate
> - Examples: ocean containers, trailers, ship holds, air containers, box cars, gondola cars, etc.

> **(2) Vehicles**
> Transportation motive power units, laden with containers
> - Sometimes integrated with containers, sometimes separate
> - May move with either or both of loaded or empty containers
> - Examples: tractors, locomotives, tugboats, ships, aircraft

> **(3) Operators**
> Onboard humans that pilot vehicles (<u>hardest to manage</u>)
> - Single persons, or crews
> - Often most constrained resource
>   - safety regulations
>   - work rules
>   - limits on human performance
> - Often most costly resource

### 4.2 Fixed Resources
> **(1) Terminals**
> Multi-function facilities: (eg. sea port)
> 1. Enable <u>freight transfer</u> between containers and vehicles
> 2. Enable <u>mode changes</u> (eg. ocean to truck)
> 3. Consolidation and de-consolidation
> 4. Temporary storage of freight, containers, vehicles
> 5. Maintenance and operator base

> **(2) Right-of-way (ROW)**
> Connecting infrastructure enabling vehicles to move <u>between terminals and customers</u>
> - Public ROW includes roadways, airways, waterways in U.S. (并不是不用钱, pay usage fee, tax...)
> - Private ROW includes railroads and pipelines

## 5. System Configurations
<span style="background-color: yellow; color: black;">Direct vs. Consolidation</span>

> **Consolidation**
> To take advantage of cost economies of scale, most freight transportation systems use some form of consolidation

### 5.1 Container-level
1. **Direct**
   - Customer provided complete container
   - Load at origin, unload at destination
   - Truckload trucking, ocean containerized shipping, rail carload services
2. **Consolidation**
   - Operator loads and unload shipments into containers as needed
   - LTL, package expres

### 5.2 Vehicle-level
1. **Direct**
   - Vehicles integrated with containers, or
   - Each vehicle moves a single container at a time
   - Truckload, unit trains
2. **Consolidation**
   - Multiple containers packed onto vehicles
   - General freight trains, pup trains, container ships
