# Economic Order Quantity Model
</center>

[Chapter 15.2]

## 1. EOQ Model
**Notations & Assumptions**: $t = 1$ means one year.
- $D=D(1)$ yearly demand (deterministic and constant)
- $q$ **<font color=red>decision variable</font>** (order size)
- $p$ unit cost
- $K$ set up cost per order
- $h$ is holding cost per unit per time
- $L=0$ assume <u>no lead time</u>
- <u>no backorder</u>, <u>no shortage</u>

> What is **backorder**?
> A backorder is an order for a good or service that cannot be filled at the current time due to a lack of available supply. The item may not be held in the company's available inventory but could still be in production or in transition

### 1.1 General Case
> **EOQ(Economic Order Quantity)**
> $$\boxed{q^*=\sqrt{\frac{2KD}{h}}}$$

**How we get that?**
- Let $TC$ represent the annual total cost. Note that this total cost depends on $q$. Thus TC is a function of q and its expression is as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}
TC(q) &= \text{setup cost+annual purchasing cost+annual holding cost}\\
&= K\frac{D}{q} + pD + h\frac{q}{2}
\end{aligned}$$

- Then we could get EOQ by solving:
$$\frac{d}{dq}TC(q)=-\frac{KD}{q^2}+\frac{h}{2}=0$$

- Why EOQ is a minimization solution? second derivative > 0


**Some interesting facts**:
1. Even the equation of $q^*$ is not related to $p$, while $p$ will often affect $h$ and then affect $q^*$
2. The optimal $q$ is achieved when the setup cost and holding cost are equal
   这是由 $TC(q)$ 的公式决定的，如果再加一项关于 $q$ 的公式就不会这么巧了

### 1.2 Lead Time > 0
When lead time > 0 and is a constant, we should place an order when the stock level is large enough to cover the demand during the lead time which is $LD$. Thus the **reorder point** $r$ is $r = LD$
- If $LD<EOQ$, $r=LD$
- If $LD>EOQ$, $r=LD\text{ mod }EOQ$

For a long lead time, the pipline cost(or trasit cost) is sometimes considered and is equal to $q(Lh)(D/q) = DLh$






## 2. Gaussian Demand Process
**Definitions**: Let $D(t)$ represent the demand during time $t$ (in years) and $E[D(1)]=\bar{d}, Var[D(1)]=\sigma_d^2$. Then a Gaussian demand process has
$$D(t)\sim N(t\bar{d},t\sigma_d^2)$$
