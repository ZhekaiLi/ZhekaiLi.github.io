	- By reserving lots, we can make it more difficult for the scheduler to switch a lot to a new tool or change the order of lots on the tool.  While this may mean we miss some opportunities for a technically better schedule (e.g. could start the lot 30 minutes earlier on another tool), it provides a more consistent list of lots for a given tool and lets operators better plan for their work - e.g. which reticles are needed, which lots need to be moved, what setup changes need to be coordinated, etc....
