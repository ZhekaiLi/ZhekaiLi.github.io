then comes into a [[Machine Recipe]]



### Equipment > Throughput > Equipment Types > Name of Equipment Type > Name of Process

Named as *Process Family - Process*
[AA RESIST COAT - N_COAT - Throughput - Newbury Park (ad.skynet)](http://ivnwfpswebprd01.ad.skynet/Dashboard/Equipment/Throughput/StatsForEquipmentTypeProcess?facility=NPK&EqpType=N_COAT&process=AA%20RESIST%20COAT)

Ex:

这一对 Process Family - Process 会被分配给不同的 [[Machine Recipe]] (会有不同的 Entity ID, configuration 等等，一般用来满足不同产品的生产需求)
